The journal will continuously accept submissions on an ever-rolling basis and ‘publish’ them to the site after they have gone through the double-blind review process, been copy-edited, formatted, etc. Once five or six reviewed articles have been posted at the website, the journal will gather them together as a single downloadable ‘issue’ and, given the respective contents of that particular issue, recruit an appropriately resonant member from our editorial board to write an introduction or afterword that captures some of the key aspects and arguments raised across the assembled pieces.",
